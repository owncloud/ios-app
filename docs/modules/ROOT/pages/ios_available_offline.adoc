= Offline Files and Folders

== Introduction

From version 1.1.0, the ownCloud iOS app supports offline storage of files and folders, allowing them to be accessed even when an internet connection is temporarily unavailable.

== Making a File or Folder Available Offline

To make a file or folder available offline, click on the _More_ icon and press "_Make available offline_" from the list of available actions. In the screenshots below, you can see an example of the available actions for files and folders.

== Viewing Offline Files

To view all offline files, from the _Quick Access_ menu, tap _Available Offline_. If no files have been marked as available offline, then no files will be available.

If one or more files have been marked as available offline, then you have two ways of viewing them.

* View files by location
* View a list of all files

=== View Offline Files by Location

In the screenshot below, you can see that there are one or more files in the _Photos_ directory that have been marked as available offline. If you tap one of the available directories, you will then see all files in that directory that are available offline, similar to how you would view files normally.

== Storage

Locally available file copies can be set to be automatically deleted after a specified period, ranging from 1 minute to 30 days, to clean up device space. The default is seven days. This is available under menu:Settings[Storage > Delete unused local copies].

NOTE: This setting applies to all local files, not just available offline files.
