New feature: Kiteworks Integration

This PR adds Kiteworks integration to the iOS ownCloud app.
The SDK was adopted to detect a Kiteworks server and proceed with the needed logic.

The iOS app got some adoption regarding sidebar items and not to show folder sizes (as it is not available on Kiteworks server).

Compatible with Kiteworks starting version 9.1.1.
