Enhancement: iOS 26 compatibility and optimizations

Adopts the iOS 26 "Liquid Glass" look and addresses the following issues:
- less space for title in the navigation bar
- non-transparent icon in the "Share with" menu
- a visual glitch in the location picker 

It also addresses how free space is displayed, if an oCIS space has no quota.
