Change - Improved sidebar with account-wide search: [#1320](https://github.com/owncloud/ios-app/pull/1320)

This PR:
- removes `Quick Access` from the sidebar, redistributing its prior contents as follows:
  - `Recents`: promoted to a top-level sidebar item
  - `Favorites`: promoted to a top-level sidebar item
  - `Available Offline`: promoted to a top-level sidebar item
  - other Quick Access items: moved as suggestions to new top-level sidebar `Search` item, with a dedicated `Add to sidebar` button that allows re-adding the previous Quick Access items as saved search
  - Saved searches now appear as top-level items in the sidebar
- adds custom user sidebar items
  - can be added via `Add to sidebar`
  - support drag and drop (also cross-account)
  - managed via context menu, swipe and `Remove from sidebar` actions
- in the share extension automatically connects to the first account if only one account is in the account (superseding [#1296](https://github.com/owncloud/ios-app/pull/1296))
- incorporates the latest SDK with important fixes
